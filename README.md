# Online-Courses-analysis
This project analyzes the trends in online course enrollment over the period from 2000 to 2024. As digital learning platforms have grown in popularity, tracking enrollment data across different subject areas provides insights into shifts in learner interests, technological adoption, and the evolving demand for specific skills. The study focuses on three major course categories — Programming, Business, and Design — and examines how enrollment numbers have changed over time. The project uses visual representations to better understand these trends and their implications for education and workforce development in the digital age.
